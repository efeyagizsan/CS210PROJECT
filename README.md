The project's goal is to generate video game recommendations based on user input and my steam library. This endeavor will assist those who wish to explore and discover new games.

The recommendation model is constructed with "NearestNeighbors," an unsupervised machine learning technique that employs distance calculation to determine the similarity or dissimilarity of data points.

Calculate the distance between the input and every data point in a dataset.
Choose the data points with the shortest distance as the nearest neighbors.
